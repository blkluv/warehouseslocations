## 🏥 A Landmark Achievement in Healthcare-Adjacent Development

SK Commercial Realty is proud to spotlight the leadership and expertise of its **SK Project Consulting (SKPC)** division following the successful completion of a landmark project for Atlanta Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC).

After more than seven years of planning, coordination, and execution led by **Todd Cohen, President of SKPC**, the new Ronald McDonald House held its ribbon cutting ceremony on **December 9, 2025**, with families welcomed beginning the following day on the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Arthur M. Blank Hospital campus in North Druid Hills.

The five-story, **126,000-square-foot facility** is the **first Ronald McDonald House in the Southeast** to be fully co-located on a hospital campus, reinforcing RMHC's mission to keep families close to the care their children need most.

## 📋 Seven Years of Strategic Execution

SK Project Consulting began work on the project in **2018**, serving as RMHC's project consultant and trusted advisor throughout every phase of development. From early planning and evolving budgets to final delivery, SKPC managed a complex, multi-year process that required adaptability, discipline, and deep technical knowledge.

Acting as the central point of coordination, the SKPC team assembled and led a best-in-class group of architects, engineers, designers, and specialty consultants, while overseeing:
- Design and construction
- Technology integration
- Furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E)
- Signage and wayfinding
- Specialty elements and playscape development

Every decision was executed to ensure alignment with RMHC's vision, schedule, and financial goals.

> "The new house is our most satisfying project to date. It was rewarding to manage the charity's 30-guest-room house on Peachtree-Dunwoody Road, but this new 110-room house on the amazing new campus is like no other. The charity's amazing leadership and team members enabled the success of the entire development team."
